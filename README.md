# PLY Loader for Modo

With this kit installed it should be possible to load .ply files like the ones from [Stanfords 3D Scanning Repository](http://graphics.stanford.edu/data/3Dscanrep/)

Mostly done as a pet project to see how to make custom loaders in Modo.

If you find any issues don't hesitate to submit one.

The Kit should be compatible with both python 2 & 3 and shouldn't require any dependencies but for standard library and the included modules from Modo.

## TODO:

- unittesting
- sphinx documentation
- full pep8 compliant
